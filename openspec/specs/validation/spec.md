# Validation

## Purpose
Built-in validation of OpenSpec project structure, spec format, config integrity, delta spec correctness, and artifact completeness — with real-time IDE inspections and file watching.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Config validation

The plugin SHALL validate `config.yaml` for structural correctness, required fields, version presence, version recognition, and schema-version compatibility. Validation SHALL use the `VersionSupport` enum to determine which fields and schemas are valid for the declared version.

#### Scenario: Config parsed successfully
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` exists and is valid YAML
- **THEN** the validator SHALL proceed with field-level checks

#### Scenario: Config missing
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` does not exist or cannot be parsed
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with rule `config-missing`

#### Scenario: Schema field required
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has no `schema` field
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with rule `config-schema-required`

#### Scenario: Schema value invalid for version
- **WHEN** the `schema` value is not in the declared version's valid schemas
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `config-schema-invalid`

#### Scenario: Version field missing
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has no `version` field
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `config-version-required`

#### Scenario: Version value unrecognized
- **WHEN** the `version` value does not match any known OpenSpec version
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `config-version-unknown`

#### Scenario: Required config fields enforced
- **WHEN** the declared version requires specific config fields (per `VersionSupport.getRequiredConfigFields()`)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with rule `config-field-required` for each missing required field

#### Scenario: Profile field recommended
- **WHEN** `config.yaml` has no `profile` field
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `config-profile-recommended`

### Requirement: Spec format validation

The plugin SHALL validate spec files for structural completeness: title heading, requirement blocks, RFC 2119 keywords, and scenario format.

#### Scenario: Missing title heading
- **WHEN** a spec file has no `# Title` heading
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-title-required`

#### Scenario: Missing requirement block
- **WHEN** a spec file has no `### Requirement:` section
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-requirement-required`

#### Scenario: Missing RFC 2119 keywords
- **WHEN** a requirement block contains no RFC 2119 keywords (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, SHALL NOT, SHOULD NOT)
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-rfc-keywords`

#### Scenario: Missing scenario
- **WHEN** a requirement block has no `#### Scenario:` section
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-scenario-required`

#### Scenario: Scenario missing clauses
- **WHEN** a scenario block is missing a WHEN clause, a THEN clause, or both
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `spec-scenario-clauses`

### Requirement: Change validation

The plugin SHALL validate each active change's `.openspec.yaml` for schema compatibility with the project's declared version. The validator SHALL use `VersionSupport.getValidSchemas()` to determine allowed schemas.

#### Scenario: Proposal required
- **WHEN** a change has no `proposal.md`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with rule `change-proposal-required`

#### Scenario: Required artifacts for version
- **WHEN** the declared version requires specific artifacts and a change is missing one
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING (or ERROR in strict mode) with rule `change-artifact-missing`

#### Scenario: Change schema incompatible with project version
- **WHEN** a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares a schema not in the project version's valid schemas
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-schema-incompatible`

### Requirement: Delta spec validation

The plugin SHALL validate delta spec files for structural correctness, including section headings (ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED), removal metadata, and scenario coverage.

#### Scenario: Missing delta sections
- **WHEN** a delta spec file under a change's `specs/` directory has no ADDED, MODIFIED, or REMOVED sections
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with code `delta-spec-sections`

#### Scenario: Removed requirement missing metadata
- **WHEN** a REMOVED requirement block is missing a **Reason** field or a **Migration** field
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `delta-removed-fields`

#### Scenario: Added requirement missing scenario
- **WHEN** an ADDED requirement block has no `#### Scenario:` section
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `delta-requirement-scenario`

#### Scenario: Modified requirement missing scenario
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement block has no `#### Scenario:` section with updated content
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report an ERROR with code `delta-requirement-scenario`

### Requirement: Delta spec IDE inspection

The plugin SHALL provide a real-time IDE inspection for delta spec files, highlighting structural problems as the user edits.

#### Scenario: Inspection scope
- **WHEN** a file is located under `openspec/changes/<change>/specs/` and is named `spec.md`
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL apply delta spec inspections to that file

#### Scenario: Inspection highlights errors inline
- **WHEN** a delta spec file has a REMOVED requirement missing metadata or an ADDED requirement missing a scenario
- **THEN** the IDE SHALL display inline error highlights at the relevant locations

### Requirement: Scaffolding content detection

The plugin SHALL distinguish between scaffolding placeholder content and real authored content, overriding artifact status accordingly.

#### Scenario: Placeholder detection
- **WHEN** an artifact file contains only template placeholders or boilerplate headings with no substantive content
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL report the artifact as scaffolding and override its status to READY (not DONE)

### Requirement: Artifact file watching

The plugin SHALL auto-detect artifact file changes via VFS listeners and refresh pipeline status after clipboard or editor delivery.

#### Scenario: File save triggers refresh
- **WHEN** a user saves an artifact file after pasting AI-generated content
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL detect the VFS change and update the artifact's pipeline status
