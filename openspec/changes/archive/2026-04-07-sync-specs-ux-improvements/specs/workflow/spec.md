## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Archive action

The plugin SHALL move completed changes to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/` with post-archive commit, push, and tracker updates. A Bulk Archive option SHALL be available when multiple active changes exist. When the change contains unsynced delta specs, the plugin SHALL prompt the user before proceeding with a three-option dialog.

#### Scenario: Archive flow
- **WHEN** the user archives a change
- **THEN** the change SHALL be moved to the archive directory and post-archive steps SHALL execute

#### Scenario: Bulk archive entry point
- **WHEN** multiple active changes exist
- **THEN** a Bulk Archive action SHALL be available in the menu and toolbar

#### Scenario: Archive guard with unsynced delta specs
- **WHEN** the user clicks Archive and the change has unsynced delta specs (`hasDeltaSpecs` is true)
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL display a confirmation dialog with three options: "Sync First", "Archive Without Syncing", and "Cancel"

#### Scenario: Archive guard — Sync First
- **WHEN** the user selects "Sync First" from the archive guard dialog
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL trigger the sync specs workflow and SHALL NOT proceed with archiving

#### Scenario: Archive guard — Archive Without Syncing
- **WHEN** the user selects "Archive Without Syncing" from the archive guard dialog
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL proceed with archiving the change as-is, including the unsynced delta specs

#### Scenario: Archive guard — Cancel
- **WHEN** the user selects "Cancel" from the archive guard dialog
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL abort the archive action and take no further action

#### Scenario: Archive without delta specs
- **WHEN** the user clicks Archive and the change has no delta specs (`hasDeltaSpecs` is false)
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL proceed directly with archiving without showing the guard dialog
