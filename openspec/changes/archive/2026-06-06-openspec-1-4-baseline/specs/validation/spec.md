## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: workspace-planning schema acceptance

The plugin SHALL accept `workspace-planning` as a valid workflow schema for projects on schema-version baseline V1_2 or later, alongside the original `spec-driven` schema. Projects on V1_0 or V1_1 SHALL continue to accept only `spec-driven`, because `workspace-planning` was introduced upstream in OpenSpec CLI 1.4.x.

#### Scenario: workspace-planning accepted under V1_2
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.2.x` (or any version that resolves to `VersionSupport.V1_2`) and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: workspace-planning`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `change-schema-incompatible`

#### Scenario: spec-driven still accepted under V1_2
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.2.x` and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: spec-driven`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL NOT report `change-schema-incompatible`

#### Scenario: workspace-planning rejected under V1_0
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.0.x` (resolving to `VersionSupport.V1_0`) and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: workspace-planning`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-schema-incompatible`

#### Scenario: workspace-planning rejected under V1_1
- **WHEN** a project declares `version: 1.1.x` (resolving to `VersionSupport.V1_1`) and a change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `schema: workspace-planning`
- **THEN** the validator SHALL report a WARNING with rule `change-schema-incompatible`
