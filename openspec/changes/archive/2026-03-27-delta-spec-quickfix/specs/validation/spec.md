## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Delta spec IDE inspection

The plugin SHALL provide a real-time IDE inspection for delta spec files, highlighting structural problems as the user edits. For MODIFIED requirements missing scenarios, the inspection SHALL offer a quick-fix that copies the full requirement block from the corresponding main spec.

#### Scenario: Inspection scope
- **WHEN** a file is located under `openspec/changes/<change>/specs/` and is named `spec.md`
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL apply delta spec inspections to that file

#### Scenario: Inspection highlights errors inline
- **WHEN** a delta spec file has a REMOVED requirement missing metadata or an ADDED requirement missing a scenario
- **THEN** the IDE SHALL display inline error highlights at the relevant locations

#### Scenario: Quick-fix for MODIFIED requirement missing scenarios
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement has no `#### Scenario:` section and the requirement exists in the main spec
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL offer a quick-fix that replaces the requirement block with the full content from `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`

#### Scenario: Quick-fix unavailable when main spec missing
- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement has no scenarios but no matching requirement exists in the main spec
- **THEN** the inspection SHALL report the error without offering a quick-fix
