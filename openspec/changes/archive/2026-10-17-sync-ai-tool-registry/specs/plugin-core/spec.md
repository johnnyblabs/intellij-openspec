## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: AI tool detection

The plugin SHALL detect every AI tool in the OpenSpec CLI's tool registry (`AI_TOOLS` in `@fission-ai/openspec/dist/core/config.js`; 50 tools at 1.14.3) from one record per tool carrying its id, display name, skills directory, detection paths, older directories, type (CLI vs IDE_PANEL), and the first CLI version that accepts the id. Detection SHALL follow upstream's rule: the tool's detection paths when it has them, otherwise its skills directory, with older directories also counting, a skills root that several tools share attributed the way upstream attributes it (its `skills/.openspec-target` marker, then the invocation syntax in its generated skills), and a tool with a global skills directory detected from the user's home directory. The plugin SHALL offer or pass a tool id to the CLI only when the detected CLI version accepts it.

#### Scenario: Tool detection
- **WHEN** `AiToolDetectionService.detect()` scans the project root
- **THEN** it SHALL check every registry tool by upstream's detection rule and classify each as CLI or IDE_PANEL

#### Scenario: Junie detected as IDE panel
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.junie` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Junie" in detected tools, classified as IDE_PANEL, with CLI ID `junie`

#### Scenario: Lingma detected as IDE panel
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.lingma` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Lingma" in detected tools, classified as IDE_PANEL, with CLI ID `lingma`

#### Scenario: ForgeCode detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.forge` directory (the upstream-emitted directory for ForgeCode)
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "ForgeCode" in detected tools, classified as CLI, with CLI ID `forgecode`

#### Scenario: Bob Shell detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.bob` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list the tool under its current registry name "IBM Bob" (accepting the former name "Bob Shell" for a saved preference), classified as CLI, with CLI ID `bob`

#### Scenario: Kimi CLI detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.kimi-code` directory (where OpenSpec 1.7+ writes it) or the older `.kimi` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list the tool under its current registry name "Kimi Code" (accepting the former name "Kimi CLI" for a saved preference), classified as CLI, with CLI ID `kimi`

#### Scenario: Mistral Vibe detected as CLI tool
- **WHEN** the project root contains a `.vibe` directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL list "Mistral Vibe" in detected tools, classified as CLI, with CLI ID `vibe`

#### Scenario: ForgeCode directory key differs from CLI ID
- **WHEN** the plugin maps display name "ForgeCode" to a CLI ID
- **THEN** it SHALL emit `forgecode` (matching upstream `--tools forgecode`), even though the directory key in `TOOL_DIRS` is `.forge`

#### Scenario: Pre-1.3.x tools still detected
- **WHEN** a project holds a tool's directory from before a registry change (such as `.windsurf` for Devin Desktop, `.codex` for Codex, `.agent` for Antigravity, or `.roo` for Zoo Code) or any other pre-1.3.x tool directory
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL still detect that tool, with the CLI ID the registry accepts for it (`windsurf` for Devin Desktop, which every supported CLI accepts), so existing projects don't regress; GitHub Copilot SHALL be detected only from its registry detection paths, not from any `.github` directory

#### Scenario: The plugin's tools equal the CLI's registry
- **WHEN** the plugin's tool records are compared with the registry captured from CLI 1.14.3
- **THEN** every registry id SHALL have a record with the same display name, skills directory and detection paths, and no record SHALL name an id the registry lacks

#### Scenario: A tool newer than the detected CLI is not offered
- **WHEN** the detected CLI is older than the first version that accepts a tool's id (for example 1.3.0 and a tool added in 1.14.0)
- **THEN** the plugin SHALL NOT offer that tool for `init` or `update`, nor pass its id in `--tools`
