## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Workflow action panel

The plugin SHALL display the selected change's pipeline status with interactive artifact chips that serve as the primary action surface. Pipeline chips SHALL be clickable (READY → generate, DONE → open file) with right-click context menus. A compact icon action bar SHALL provide secondary actions (Fast-Forward, Verify, Archive, overflow menu). A single-line status strip SHALL show compliance, task progress, and delivery mode. The panel SHALL NOT use a horizontal button row for workflow actions.

#### Scenario: Pipeline visualization
- **WHEN** a change is selected
- **THEN** the panel SHALL show interactive artifact status chips (DONE, READY, BLOCKED, GENERATING) with content-aware scaffolding detection, hover affordances, and click/right-click actions

#### Scenario: Generate via chip click
- **WHEN** the user clicks a READY chip
- **THEN** it SHALL deliver via the selected method (clipboard, editor tab, or Direct API) with a guidance popover showing post-delivery feedback

#### Scenario: Sync Specs in overflow menu
- **WHEN** all artifacts are complete and the change contains delta spec sections
- **THEN** the overflow menu SHALL include a "Sync Specs" item

#### Scenario: Sync Specs hidden from overflow
- **WHEN** the change has no delta spec sections
- **THEN** the overflow menu SHALL NOT include "Sync Specs"

#### Scenario: Compliance chip displayed
- **WHEN** the workflow action panel renders for a selected change
- **THEN** the status strip SHALL include compliance status alongside task progress and delivery mode
