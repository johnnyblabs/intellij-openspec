## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cross-platform CLI detection

`CliDetectionService` SHALL detect the OpenSpec CLI on Windows under the same scenarios that succeed on macOS and Linux. On Windows the service SHALL extend bare candidate paths through `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.exe` suffixes when direct invocation fails, SHALL resolve the executable via `where.exe` instead of a POSIX login shell, and SHALL probe Windows-specific install locations derived from `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. The macOS and Linux detection paths SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Windows bare-name resolution falls back through executable suffixes
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and `tryPath("openspec")` is called and bare invocation fails
- **THEN** the service SHALL retry the candidate with `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.exe` suffixes in that order, accepting the first variant whose `--version` invocation exits 0

#### Scenario: Windows extension fallback only applies when no extension is present
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the candidate path already ends in `.cmd`, `.bat`, or `.exe`
- **THEN** the service SHALL invoke that exact path without appending further suffixes

#### Scenario: Windows shell PATH is resolved via where.exe
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the bare-name and settings-path branches have not produced a hit
- **THEN** the service SHALL invoke `where.exe openspec` (not `/bin/zsh -lc`) and use the first non-empty stdout line as the next candidate path

#### Scenario: Windows common npm paths are probed
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and prior detection branches have not produced a hit
- **THEN** the service SHALL try, in order, `%APPDATA%\npm\openspec.cmd`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\npm\openspec.cmd`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\openspec.cmd`, skipping any candidate whose environment variable is unset

#### Scenario: User-supplied path with extension works as-is
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the user has set the Settings CLI path to a path ending in `.cmd`, `.bat`, or `.exe`
- **THEN** the service SHALL invoke that path verbatim and SHALL NOT attempt suffix variants

#### Scenario: User-supplied bare path is extended on Windows
- **WHEN** the host OS is Windows and the user has set the Settings CLI path to a value with no extension
- **THEN** the service SHALL apply the same `.cmd` / `.bat` / `.exe` fallback as for auto-detected bare names

#### Scenario: macOS and Linux behavior unchanged
- **WHEN** the host OS is macOS or Linux
- **THEN** detection SHALL execute the existing branches (bare name → `/bin/zsh -lc which openspec` → `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`) without invoking any Windows-specific code path

#### Scenario: Windows detection completes within the existing timeout
- **WHEN** detection runs on Windows and traverses the suffix-fallback, `where.exe`, and common-paths branches
- **THEN** the total wall-clock time SHALL be bounded by the existing `TIMEOUT_MS` budget per `runAndCapture` invocation, with no additional global wait introduced
